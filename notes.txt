    1. Retrieve robot position using the sensors
      - Inertial Mass Unit
      - GPS Coordinates
      - Gyro
    2. Blink the front LEDs alternatively with 1 second rate -- indicates the sensors are working
    3. Stabilize camera by actuating the camera motors according to the gyro feed -- currently does not work
    4. Obtain PID values:
      - PID control for x position - XController
      - PID control for altitude position - AltitudeController
      - PID control for z position - ZController
      - PID control for yaw - RotationController
    5. Calculate motor inputs based on PID Controls
    6. Set motor velocities based on calculated motor inputs

## Notes

In the context of drones or aircraft, roll, pitch, and yaw are used to describe the orientation or rotation of the 
vehicle in three-dimensional space. They are typically defined as follows:

- Roll: Rotation around the longitudinal axis (usually the x-axis), which runs from the front to the back of the 
vehicle. Imagine an airplane tilting its wings from side to side.
- Pitch: Rotation around the lateral axis (usually the y-axis), which runs from one side of the vehicle to the other. 
This motion is similar to nodding your head up and down.
- Yaw: Rotation around the vertical axis (usually the z-axis), which runs from the top to the bottom of the vehicle. 
Yawing is like turning your head from side to side to look left or right.

So, in terms of a coordinate system, 
  - roll could be associated with changes in the x-axis, 
  - pitch would typically be associated with changes in the y-axis, and 
  - yaw, would be associated with changes in the z-axis.

## On adjustments

To adjust your drone for better hovering based on the provided values, you can focus on the following parameters:

1. Pitch and Roll: These angles should ideally be close to zero for the drone to hover level. If they are consistently 
away from zero, adjust the pitch and roll controls to bring them closer to zero.
2. Altitude: The altitude should be stable around your desired hover height. If it is drifting or fluctuating, adjust 
the vertical thrust control (K_VERTICAL_THRUST) to stabilize the altitude.
3. Pitch Acceleration and Roll Acceleration: These values should ideally be close to zero, indicating minimal angular 
acceleration. If they are consistently high, it might indicate instability. Adjust the PID gains (kp_x, kd_x, kp_z, 
kd_z) for pitch and roll to dampen the oscillations.
4. Propeller Velocities: Monitor the propeller velocities for each corner of the drone. If one side is consistently 
higher than the other, it could cause the drone to tilt. Adjust the corresponding control inputs to balance the 
propeller speeds and level the drone.
5. Yaw: Ensure that the yaw control is responsive and keeps the drone oriented as desired.
