main control loop

    1. Retrieve robot position using the sensors
      - Inertial Mass Unit
      - GPS Coordinates
      - Gyro
    2. Blink the front LEDs alternatively with 1 second rate -- indicates the sensors are working
    3. Stabilize camera by actuating the camera motors according to the gyro feed -- currently does not work
    4. Obtain PID values:
      - PID control for x position - XController
      - PID control for altitude position - AltitudeController
      - PID control for z position - ZController
      - PID control for yaw - RotationController
    5. Calculate motor inputs based on PID Controls
    6. Set motor velocities based on calculated motor inputs

## Notes

In the context of drones or aircraft, roll, pitch, and yaw are used to describe the orientation or rotation of the 
vehicle in three-dimensional space. They are typically defined as follows:

- Roll: Rotation around the longitudinal axis (usually the x-axis), which runs from the front to the back of the 
vehicle. Imagine an airplane tilting its wings from side to side.
- Pitch: Rotation around the lateral axis (usually the y-axis), which runs from one side of the vehicle to the other. 
This motion is similar to nodding your head up and down.
- Yaw: Rotation around the vertical axis (usually the z-axis), which runs from the top to the bottom of the vehicle. 
Yawing is like turning your head from side to side to look left or right.

So, in terms of a coordinate system, 
  - roll could be associated with changes in the x-axis, 
  - pitch would typically be associated with changes in the y-axis, and 
  - yaw, would be associated with changes in the z-axis.
